#Overview

The purposes of this project are to:

1. teach myself how to use ChromeDriver

2. practice webscraping

3. analyze a scraped data set

4. Practice creating Tableau visualizations with the scraped data

5. teach myself how to create a webpage that takes user input and returns webscraped results



The actions/goals of the project are:

1. Scrape the top twenty most popular baby names for each available year (1880 - 2022) from the Social Security Administration's website.

2. Create a Data Frame of all the scraped data and Series of the counts of each name in the years searched (for graphing purposes).

3. Use Pandas to analyze the name trends across the years

4. Use Tableau to create more complex visualizations

5. Create a website using Flask, Python, and Javascript that asks users what they want to search and returns the 20 most popular names for those years.

6. Add functionality to the website that allows users to also search for specific names and learn their popularity trends, as well as years.

7. Depending on how things go, I'd like to flesh out the project by accessing and displaying basic etymological information for searched names.
